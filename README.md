<h2>A Role Mining technique based on Bag of Words model</h2>

<div align='justify'>
The widespread adoption of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) stems from its flexibility in enforcing and managing security policies across diverse contexts. To accurately reflect organizational security requirements, cardinality constraints are often incorporated into role definition and assignment. However, role mining, the process of generating an RBAC model from existing data, is an NP-hard problem. Consequently, heuristic approaches, which yield approximate solutions, are necessary.

We introduces a novel role mining methodology that leverages the Bag of Words model, a technique commonly used in document representation and knowledge extraction. We present several heuristics and evaluate their performance on standard datasets, employing various metrics and indicators. The results demonstrate that our approach offers improved solutions and a viable alternative for constrained RBAC model generation.

The heuristics were validated using publicly available real-world datasets from HP Labs [1], which are also included in the 'datasets' folder.

The complete set of experiments is available in the pdf file Additional Material.pdf.
